    From DVSO (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02570)

    This regularization penalizes the overall disparity in the image, encouraging the network to select background
    disparities.

    NOTE: In this case we CANNOT apply mean normalization to the input disparity. By definition, this fixes the mean of
    all elements to 1, meaning the loss is impossible to minimize.

    NOTE: The benefits of applying this regularization to purely monocular supervision are unclear,
    since the loss could simply be optimized by making all disparities smaller.

    :param invert: (bool) If `True`, encourage foreground disparities instead of background.
